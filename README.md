This project is part of the Rothamsted Data Hackathon<https://github.com/Rothamsted-Ecoinformatics/RothDataHackathon2025>. We have used data from the electronic Rothamstead archive long-term experiment data (https://www.era.rothamsted.ac.uk/) on growth on winte rwheat (Broadbalk) over the years 1990-2000, and 2010-2020. Over these two periods, we look at the correlations between grain and straw yield, fertiliser use (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium), CO2 emission as calculated from nitrogen application, meterological data (rainfall, temperature), and insect prevalence from the Rothamsted Insect Survey https://insectsurvey.com/.
