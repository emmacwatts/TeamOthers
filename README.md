This project is part of the Rothamsted Data Hackathon. We used data from the Electronic Rothamsted Archive (e-RA) on long-term winter wheat experiments (Broadbalk) covering the periods 1990–2000 and 2010–2020.

Across these two time spans, we explore correlations between grain and straw yield, fertiliser use (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium), estimated CO₂ emissions (based on nitrogen application), meteorological data (rainfall and temperature), and insect prevalence data from the Rothamsted Insect Survey.
