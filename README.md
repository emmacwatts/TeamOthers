This project is part of the [Rothamsted Data Hackathon](https://github.com/Rothamsted-Ecoinformatics/RothDataHackathon2025). We used data from the [Electronic Rothamsted Archive (e-RA)](https://www.era.rothamsted.ac.uk/) on long-term winter wheat experiments (Broadbalk) covering the periods 1990â€“2000 and 2010â€“2020. We used [Dataset: Broadbalk Wheat annual grain and straw yields 1968-2022](https://www.era.rothamsted.ac.uk/dataset/rbk1/01-YLD6822) ðŸŒ±

Across these two time spans, we explore correlations between grain and straw yield, fertiliser use (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium), estimated COâ‚‚ emissions (based on nitrogen application), meteorological data (rainfall and temperature), and insect prevalence data from the [Rothamsted Insect Survey](https://insectsurvey.com/). ðŸª°

This platform has been developed with the aim of being **accessible to those who would most benefit from the data**. Plots are designed to be modular and interactive.
