Figure 1: Grain and Straw Yield of Winter Wheat and Impact of Fertiliser, Weather, and Insect presence (1990–2000 vs 2010–2020)
These figures show yearly trends of all variables included in the Broadbalk winter wheat dataset for two time periods (1990–2000 and 2010–2020). The variables plotted are grain and straw yields, fertiliser applications (N, P, K), estimated CO₂ emissions from nitrogen inputs, meteorological data (rainfall and temperature), and insect counts for Metopolophium dirhodum, Rhopalosiphum padi, and Sitobion avenae. Units for grain and straw yierld are t/ha at 85% dry matter, kg/ha for fertiliser application, and a mean in ˚C for temp, a total sum of rainfall, and kg/CO2 for GHG emission.

Figure 2: Correlation of Yield and Aphid Abundance by Period (1990–2000 vs 2010–2020) – Heatmap Comparison
Description:
These paired heatmaps display the correlation coefficients between grain yield, straw yield, and the yearly total abundance of three major aphid species (Metopolophium dirhodum, Rhopalosiphum padi, and Sitobion avenae) for Strip 8, separated into two time periods (1990–2000 and 2010–2020).
Each colored square shows the strength and direction of the linear relationship (Pearson’s correlation) between pairs of variables, with positive correlations shown in red and negative in blue.
Left panel: Correlations calculated using data from 1990 to 2000.
Right panel: Correlations calculated using data from 2010 to 2020.
This side-by-side comparison reveals how the interactions between crop yields and aphid populations have changed over time, highlighting shifts in ecological dynamics and potential changes in the factors influencing both yields and pest populations. The strongest correlations can be spotted by the darkest shades, and changing correlation patterns between periods may suggest longer-term shifts in crop–aphid relationships.

 Correlation Heatmaps — Grain/Straw vs. Insect Species (1990–2000 vs 2010–2020)
Description:
This panel of two heatmaps compares the correlations between cereal yields (grain and straw) and aphid species counts for two time periods: 1990–2000 and 2010–2020.
Rows: Grain and straw yield
Columns: Each aphid species
Cell values: Pearson correlation coefficient (range -1 to 1; color-coded, blue = negative, red = positive)
Left panel (1990–2000): Shows mostly positive but weak correlations between grain/straw and insects, with the strongest between S. avenae and grain (0.38).
Right panel (2010–2020): Shows weaker or negative correlations, especially for S. avenae and M. dirhodum, suggesting a possible shift in aphid-yield relationships over decades.

Figure 4: Fertiliser use (1990–2000 vs 2010–2020)
These charts compare the relative proportions of fertiliser use in winter wheat experiments across two periods: 1990–2000 and 2010–2020. In the earlier decade, nitrogen accounted for just over half of total fertiliser inputs (53.5%), with potassium contributing around a third (33.5%) and phosphorus making up 13%. By contrast, in the 2010–2020 period, nitrogen use increased to 61.5% and potassium rose slightly to 38.5%, while phosphorus inputs dropped to 0%. It is important to note that the absence of phosphorus application in the more recent decade does not imply a depletion of soil phosphorus. Instead, this shift reflects management practices: when soil phosphorus levels are already sufficient, additional phosphorus fertiliser is unnecessary. The trend highlights both the central role of nitrogen in driving yields and the way fertiliser strategies adapt to soil nutrient availability over time.

Figure 5: Changes in Yield and Summer Weather (1990–2000 vs 2010–2020) – Strip 8 Only
Description:
This set of four boxplots compares the distributions of grain yield, straw yield, total summer rainfall, and mean summer temperature for Strip 8 between two time periods: 1990–2000 (gold) and 2010–2020 (blue).
Each panel shows the spread and central tendency of yearly values for one variable, with the X-axis indicating the period and the Y-axis showing the measured value (yield in tons per hectare, rainfall in mm, temperature in °C).
Left two plots: Grain and straw yields.
Right two plots: Summer rainfall and temperature, calculated for the same growing years.
This visualization reveals clear differences between the two decades, making it easy to compare both yields and key climate factors. Notable patterns—such as reduced yield, changing rainfall distribution, or higher summer temperatures—can be quickly seen and interpreted in the context of agricultural and environmental changes over time.

Figure 6: Yearly Abundance of Aphid Species (1990–2020) – Grouped Bar Chart
Description:
This grouped bar chart shows the annual counts of three major aphid species (Metopolophium dirhodum, Rhopalosiphum padi, and Sitobion avenae) from 1990 to 2020.
Each year on the X-axis features three colored bars (blue, green, purple), each representing one species.
Y-axis: Total count of aphids.
This plot makes compare relative abundance between species and between years, revealing both outbreak years and longer-term declines or changes in species dominance over time.
