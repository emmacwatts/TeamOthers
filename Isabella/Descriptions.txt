[13/09/2025, 21:09:19] Isabella Zhang: Image 1: Yearly Abundance of Aphid Species (1990–2020) – Grouped Bar Chart
Description:
This grouped bar chart shows the annual counts of three major aphid species (Metopolophium dirhodum, Rhopalosiphum padi, and Sitobion avenae) from 1990 to 2020.
Each year on the X-axis features three colored bars (blue, green, purple), each representing one species.
Y-axis: Total count of aphids.
This plot makes compare relative abundance between species and between years, revealing both outbreak years and longer-term declines or changes in species dominance over time.
[13/09/2025, 21:09:36] Isabella Zhang: Image 2: Correlation Heatmaps — Grain/Straw vs. Insect Species (1990–2000 vs 2010–2020)
Description:
This panel of two heatmaps compares the correlations between cereal yields (grain and straw) and aphid species counts for two time periods: 1990–2000 and 2010–2020.
Rows: Grain and straw yield
Columns: Each aphid species
Cell values: Pearson correlation coefficient (range -1 to 1; color-coded, blue = negative, red = positive)
Left panel (1990–2000): Shows mostly positive but weak correlations between grain/straw and insects, with the strongest between S. avenae and grain (0.38).
Right panel (2010–2020): Shows weaker or negative correlations, especially for S. avenae and M. dirhodum, suggesting a possible shift in aphid-yield relationships over decades.

Description:
This 2×2 panel of boxplots compares key agronomic and climate variables for two periods (1990–2000 and 2010–2020).
Top row: Grain yield (left) and straw yield (right)
Bottom row: Total summer rainfall (left) and mean summer temperature (right)
Each plot: Shows distribution, median, and range for each period.
Notable trends:
Grain yield increased in the later period, while straw yield is similar or slightly lower.
Total summer rainfall is variable in both periods.
Mean summer temperature is higher in 2010–2020, indicating a warming trend.
